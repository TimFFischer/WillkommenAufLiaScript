# Welcome to LiaScript

    --{{0}}--
Hello, if you are interested in *Open Educational Resources*, you are have come
to the right place! We want to present you a new concept for "open" in O E R.
Our project LiaScript supports the design of teaching material similar to open source software. Interested? Then click on the arrow to the right.

As you can probably already imagine, this course was also developed with
*LiaScript*. To introduce the concept we use features, provided by browser-based
execution environment.

You can run the course either in textbook form, as a lecture or similar to a
lecture script. To switch the presentation style, click on the symbol top right.
The

+ **eye** denotes the presentation of the material with additional lecture notes.
  The actual teaching content is enriched by additional information. The text
  you have just heard is now displayed in the lower part of the screen.

+ **book** displays all content in a common text document, with disabled
  animations and transitions.

+ **ear** the additional information is presented as text-to-speech. This gives
  the feeling of an actual course.

To progress through the course, please use the arrow keys on top. The display on
the left provides an overview of the structure of the course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are looking at the raw code or the rendered version with another viewer
than LiaScript, you can switch to the interactive version by clicking here:
[LiaScript](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianZug/WillkommenAufLiaScript/master/Welcome.md#1).

In the other direction, you can take a view on the "Code" by following this link

*Versions of the content of a course and their reuse in other contexts*

    --{{0}}--
How should teaching materials be created that really deserve the O E R idea?
They should be freely available AND manipulable. Some protagonists of the
community emphasize the first aspect and annotate a PDF document as open. But
courses on a topic are very different, a teacher sets varying priorities or
chooses another contexts. Hence, a complete adoption is not enough. Furthermore,
it is necessary to provide materials that can be revised and newly compiled. The
Figure illustrates this. A number of authors corrected errors and developed
content that goes into different directions. This also results in completely new
course configurations or translations of content. What other platform for a
successful multi-editor knowledge collections could be used as an inspiring
example?

Wikipedia as a web-based system has brought together millions of authors and
users. Why does this project succeeds?

    --{{1}}--
The German entry for "Federal Republic of Germany" looked back on 15850 changes
in May 2019. 3928 users have contributed to this. Wikipedia thus ensures the
timeliness and quality of the data stock. But where is the key to success?

| Reasons for success                 | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Versioning method                   | Wikipedia stores the entire history of a document. This makes it possible to reconstruct changes, to merge versions, and thus, to eliminate errors very easy.                                                                        |
| Simple context description language | The content in Wikipedia are edited in a simple description language [wikitext](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikitext). Unlike Word or PDF documents, these are simple text files that can be manipulated in the browser by anyone. |
| Integrated editor                   | Users can make changes in the description language directly within the browser. No separate tool and installation is necessary.                                                                                                      |

********************************************************************************

So can one simply transfer the concepts of Wikipedia to course content
management?

    --{{2}}--
So can you simply derive a Wikipedia for course content? The answer to this
question is clearly no. This statement is supported by the following three main
reasons: firstly, the centralized architecture of Wikipedia, secondly the
missing possibility to integrate interactive content. And thirdly, the limited
possibilities to create individual states.

From the perspective of the requirements for a platform for knowledge transfer
the Wikipedia concept includes two central limitations:

1. The centrally oriented concept concentrates all content in one place. So
   there is only one entry for a specific topic. Splitting, reusing or a new
   combination for individual purposes is not in accordance with the basic idea.
   At the same time the centralized concept gives rise to the need for an
   efficient IT infrastructure.

2. Wikitext defines a description language
  [Markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which was developed for
  enhancing text documents by structural information (headline, normal text,
  code, etc.) Different dialects are especially used for the documentation of
  software projects. Markdown documents can be transformed into HTML
  representations automatically. Hence, the author do not need explicit
  knowledge in HTML or website description. The following table shows this side
  by side:

   <table class="lia-inline lia-table">
     <thead class="lia-inline lia-table-head">
       <tr>
         <th>Markdown Content</th>
           <th>HTML Output</th>
       </tr>
       </thead>
       <tr class="lia-inline lia-table-row">
       <td>
         <code><pre style = "Lucida Console; font-size: 14px;font-style: normal;">
 # Überschrift 1
 Das ist der Text

 ## Unterüberschrift 1.A
 Das auch, nur wird dieses
 Wort __fett__ geschrieben
         </pre></code>
       </td>
       <td>
         <h2> Überschrift 1 </h2>
         Das ist der Text

         <h1> Unterüberschrift 1.A </h1>
         Das auch nur, wird dieses Wort <b>fett</b>  geschrieben
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>

   The simple semantics is advantageous for static documents but in terms of
   learning content is also the biggest limitation. Interactive elements like
   quizzes, simulations or executable code fragments cannot be implemented
   easily.

Additionally, Wikipedia is not a learning environment. Many aspects of
established platforms, like MOODLE or Ilias, are missing. However, these
teaching-learning environments lack the flexibility or versioning across system
boundaries entirely. An exchange of content is done by copying operations of
single text fragments. As soon as more complex interactive elements are
included, which are specific to the system, this is not possible.

********************************************************************************


## LiaScript Concepts

    --{{0}}--
Consequently, *LiaScript* wants to bridge between teaching-learning
environments, the Wikipedia approach and methods of distributed software
development. To achieve this, the project redefines and combines the approaches
in the following points:

| Element                            | Significance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Abstract description language      | ... guarantees immediate workability without specific software. The combination of content and explicit structure commands provides easy to understand but well organized materials.                                                                                                        |
| Versioning of the courses          | ... saving all changes of a course document allows to trace its history and to combine its content in various ways. Simple text documents are much easier to handle in this context than binary formats like docx, pptx or pdf.                                                             |
| Distributed development of content | ... unlike in Wikipedia, teachers should host and organize their course material independently. The infrastructure free approach guarantees a free access and publications of the materials without mastering individual server applications before.                                        |

> Thus, *LiaScript* aims at the realization of a browser-based courses, whose
> contents can be specified with an abstract description language. Thus,
> interactive course elements are possible without explicit programming
> knowledge, whereby the concrete elements or entire courses can be further
> processed and modified as open materials.

     {{1}}
********************************************************************************

The conceptional contributions of *LiaScript* can be summarized as follows:

1. advanced markdown syntax, which includes a wide range of interactive
   elements,
2. infra-structure independent interpretation of the content directly within the
   browser,
3. provision of different presentation formats, which provide the course
   content driven by user demands,
4. distributed version management based on the tools that are commonly used in
   open source projects and
5. an editor tool, which is freely available.

The entire content of a LiaScript document is loaded by the browser. Afterwards
the interpreter displays the document. You already know the presentation formats
lecture, notes and book.

********************************************************************************

## Markdown extensions

    --{{0}}--
LiaScript extends the language scope of Markdown in many ways, especially the
interactive elements like executable code or quizzes. In addition, there are
static elements such as diagrams or "movies". On the following pages you will
find a selection of examples. But first let's take a look at the general idea of
Markdown. In the upper part of the current page you see the content description
within the box, in the lower part the result after rendering.

The website
[Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
provides an overview of the "traditional" Markdown feature set.   As an example
for the transformation process we included a code block in the following box.

```markdown          MyMarkdownDocument.md
Markdown is the basis of *Liascript*. However, the
features  integrated in this description  language
do  not  meet  the  requirements of an interactive
learning experience.

For example, Markdown supports by default:

**Lists**

1. in
2. orded,

   * unordered or
   * embedded structure

**Tables**

| Header 1   | Header 2   |
| :--------- | :--------- |
| Item 1     | Item 2     |


**Images**

![images](https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1618/26701766821_7bea494826.jpg)<!-- width="30%" -->
```

### Integration of media content

     {{0-3}}
********************************************************************************

**Text-to-Speech Output**

The variable speech output of *LiaScript* you've already used. The integration
of notes, actual content and voices can be implemented with 32 languages. Click
right...

********************************************************************************

     {{1-3}}
********************************************************************************

... ...to hear a German text output. The sentences are not recorded but defined
by written paragraphs. The German text you just heard, is based on the following
code fragment:

```
    --{{1 Deutsch Male}}--
Hallo, dies ist eine deutsche Textausgabe, die die Flexibilität von LiaScript
bezüglich der Sprache deutlich machen soll.
```

    --{{1 Deutsch Male}}--
Hallo, dies ist eine deutsche Textausgabe, die die Flexibilität von LiaScript
bezüglich der Sprache deutlich machen soll.

The multilingualism of *LiaScript* affects various elements. Entire courses,
individual explanations can be translated and used internationally. By the way,
the language of the execution environment can be configured in the header of a
document. Supporting elements and references will also appear in the respective
language.

********************************************************************************

     {{2-3}}
********************************************************************************

**Embedding movies**

Furthermore LiaScript supports the integration of movies and sound samples by

``` markdown
 ?[audio](https://bigsoundbank.com/UPLOAD/mp3/1068.mp3)
!?[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bICfKRyKTwE)
```

There are separate configuration interfaces for both media types, which allow to
define the start time and the display size. Try it out !

********************************************************************************

**And now all together**

In LiaScript, you can dub the videos by adding text-to-speech voices. That's
much more flexible than adapting the audio track directly. Let's first take a
look at the original video of the Youtube user Björn Seidler, which can be found
at the following [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAh6P1MaYtU). At the
start of the video you will hear audio track spoken in German. We switch the
language and "reuse" the movie content.

********************************************************************************

    --{{4}}--
In this video we focus on the concepts of the analog-to-digital converters. We
will start with a look at the Atmel 8 bit controller manual. You see the basic
features that I mark with the mouse.

                                       {{4-5}}
********************************************************************************

This is now the dubbed version using the LiaScript speech output. The audio is
available as written text and can be adapted as desired.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qAh6P1MaYtU?start=15&controls=0&mute=1&showinfo=0&rel=0&autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

********************************************************************************


### Diagrams

Diagrams are an essential element when dealing with technical topics. The
diagram contained in the course description is converted into a descriptive form
by the interpreter. This means that no further tools are required for simple
representations, whose content would have to be adapted with each iteration.

JavaScript based diagrams can also be embedded directly in the LiaScript
document. This code fragment generates an XY diagram. The parameters can be
adjusted at presentation time.


```javascript
// Initialize a Line chart in the container with the ID chart1
new Chartist.Line('#chart1', {
  labels: [1, 2, 3, 4],
  series: [[100, 120, 180, 200]]
});
```
<script>@input</script>

<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart1"></div>

********************************************************************************

### Quizzes

*LiaScript* integrates 12 different variants of quizzes that can be used to
intensify the learning process by a self-testing.

    --{{0}}--
The examples for quizzes show the LiaScript code in the upper area and below the
display in the browser. The overall syntax allows to specify the format,
solutions, but also aids for the learner.

     {{0-1}}
********************************************************************************

**a) Text Quiz**

``` markdown
What did the **fish** say when he hit a **concrete wall**?

    [[dam]]
```

What did the **fish** say when he hit a **concrete wall**?

    [[dam]]

********************************************************************************


     {{1-2}}
********************************************************************************

**b) Multiple Choice**

The crosses mark very intuitively the correct solutions for the multiple choice
test. This example illustrates how additional help for the learner can be
integrated. A question mark now appears next to the "i" for the solution.

``` markdown
Please mark odd numbers!

    [[X]] 1
    [[ ]] 2
    [[X]] 3
```

Just add as many points as you wish:

    [[X]] 1
    [[ ]] 2
    [[X]] 3
    [[?]] What is the characteristic of an odd number?

More examples can be found at the following
[link](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liaScript/docs/master/README.md)

********************************************************************************

### Executable code

    --{{0}}--
Executable code is particularly important for programming training in computer
science. These can be program snippets that generate a graphical feedback or
provide an output to the console. With the browser internal interpreter, all
kinds of tools that offer a JavaScript interface can be integrated. Click on the
button below the code block to execute them. Change the code, for example to
redefine the color or to adapt the size of the circle.

In this example, the Processing tool-chain, which is a JavaScript
implementation, has been added to LiaScript. You can embed this using an
`include` statement in the document main header.

```cpp                         Processing.js
void setup() {
  size(480, 220);
}

void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    fill(0);
  } else {
    fill(255);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 80, 80);
}
```

Alternatively, you can integrate one of 32 programming languages, which can be
accessed via a web service. The advantage of this is that you can use it without
complex installation processes. Your browser becomes your development
environment. The following fragment shows an example from a [Computer Science
class](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebastianZug/SoftwareprojektRobotik/master/00_Einfuehrung.md#1),
that was used in a lecture created in LiaScript.

```cpp                     structExample.cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Student{
  std::string name;
  int matrikel;
  void printCertificate(std::string topic);
};

void Student::printCertificate(std::string topic){
  std::cout << name << " passed " << topic;
}

int main()
{
  Student Humboldt {"Alexander Humboldt", 1798};
  Humboldt.printCertificate("Softwareentwicklung");
  return 0;
}
```

## Distributed version management

    --{{0}}--
But how is the distributed development of a LiaScript course realized? The
present "lecture" itself is hosted on GitHub, a platform for hosting open source
project. There you will find millions of open source projects, now also the code
for this document.

You can download the *LiaScript* document behind this course at
[Link](https://github.com/SebastianZug/WillkommenAufLiaScript). Unfortunately,
GitHub supports only the conventional markdown, so that some elements are not
displayed correctly in the preview.

The following screenshot shows the overview of the versions since December 1st.
With this overview the contributors and their changes can be tracked
individually.

## Editor

    --{{0}}--
LiaScript documents can be edited with any text editor. In order to support
LiaScript users, we have developed plugins for an open source editor. Atom is a
free editing tool for text and code, that is available for Windows, Linux and
Mac OS.

Currently there are two extensions for the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io), which
support the development of learning content with a preview and code snippets:

[liascript-preview](https://atom.io/packages/liascript-preview): The Previewer
gives the user immediate feedback for her/his work. While in the left window
LiaScript code is edited, the resulting output appears immediately on the right
side after saving.

[liascript-snippets](https://atom.io/packages/liascript-snippets): To have
certain LiaScript constructs quickly at hand, this plugin integrates small
fragments and examples. The user simply enters a shortcut of the intended
content, for example 'liaQuiz' and a selection menu appears, displaying all
possible variants of quizzes.

## Integration

Since the winter semester 2017/18, LiaScript is used to design lectures in
computer science at the Otto-von-Guericke University and the TU Bergakademie
Freiberg. The seamless integration of respective materials in the
teaching-learning environments of both universities ensures a high level of
acceptance.
